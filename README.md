# CGR dashboard
**Author:** Yoseph Ayala

---
## General information
- I created this dashboard for the Controlaría General de la República del Perú (CGR) in collaboration with Columbia University. The general idea of this app is to analize the claims that the CGR recieved from 2013 to 2021.
- This dashboard is not finished yet.

### Structure of the repository 
- This repository has 2 scripts and 1 folder.
- CGR Dashboard shinydashboard: Version of the dashboard using shinydashboard R package. This version is faster and looks better.
- CGR Dashboard AWS: Version of the dashboard using flexdashboard R package. 

### Temporal output
- The shinydashboard is located [here](https://cglmjx-yoseph10.shinyapps.io/cgr_dashboard_shinydashboard/) 
- Once the dashboard is completed, it will be uploaded on an Amazon Web Server.
